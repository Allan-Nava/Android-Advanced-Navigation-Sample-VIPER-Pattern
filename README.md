This sample showcases the behavior of a bottom navigation view following the [Principles of
Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation#fixed) with VIPER Pattern.

 * Fixed start destination
 * Navigation state should be represented via a stack of destinations
 * The Up button never exits your app
 * Up and Back are identical within your app's task
 * Deep linking and navigating to a destination should yield the same stack
